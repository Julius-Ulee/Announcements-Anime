<p align="center">Isagi and Nagi paint countless possibilities for goals as they understand each other's weapons. Likewise,<br>Kunigami and Reo make a great effort centering around Chigiri, who has evolved one step<br>further. In the midst of all, Barou, the king of the field, was left out<br>from the chain of evolution because of his strong ego. When Isagi takes the leading<br>role of the field from him, the sense of defeat makes Barou kneel down to<br>the ground.</p>
